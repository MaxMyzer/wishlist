## Geolocation Events
Current implementation: Geolocation events are entity events that are for a point location
Desired implementation: Allow for more complicated events. Examples or usecases and attributes:
- "1D" path
  - trace on a devices location over time
  - storm arrival 
- 2D polygon 
  - effected areas of a weather alert
  - area of a power outage
